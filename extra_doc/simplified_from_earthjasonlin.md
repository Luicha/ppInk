# Using a simplified version

## Why creating a simplified version

In one word, I think it may be too complicated and annoying for some of the users to config the software. For more details, refer to [[Feature] A Light Version · Issue #230 · pubpub-zz/ppInk · GitHub](https://github.com/pubpub-zz/ppInk/issues/230)

## What's the difference

It disables some "advanced" functions that may not be used so frequently, such as ClipArts, magnets and so on.

What it looks like:

*Though this simplified version disables many features like magnet art, they can be enabled in the setting page.*

## How to use it

1. Download the [config.ini](config.ini) and [pens.ini](pens.ini)

2. Put the files in to your program directory, and replace the default ones.

**REMEMBER TO MAKE A BACKUP**
